  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>R<sup>6</sup>RS and R<sup>7</sup>RS define a
  <strong>command-line</strong> procedure. While a useful baseline,
  the specification is not detailed enough to cover all practical
  situations. This SRFI clarifies the definition of
  <strong>command-line</strong> and adds a few related procedures.
  Precise semantics for Unix and Windows are given. Scheme scripts,
  standalone executables, compilation and REPL use are accounted
  for. Option parsing is out of scope.</p>

  <h2 id="_rationale">Rationale</h2>
  <h3 id="_os_executables">OS executables</h3>
  <p>When a Scheme implementation is run on a conventional
  operating system, the OS runs an <em>executable</em>. An
  executable is a file that contains a program in a format suitable
  for the OS. In the case of Scheme, the executable can
  represent:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>A standalone Scheme program.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A Scheme implementation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A virtual machine (such as the Java Virtual Machine or the
      .NET Common Language Runtime) hosting the Scheme
      implementation, which in turn hosts the Scheme program.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="_os_command_lines">OS command lines</h3>
  <p>The OS gives the executable a <em>command line</em>. The
  command line is a vector of strings. There is a ubiquitous
  convention that the first string represents the <em>command
  name</em>. Any remaining strings are <em>command arguments</em>
  interpreted differently by each program.</p>
  <p>Command lines are extremely portable. Practically all
  general-purpose operating systems provide them. As long as
  command names are used for display purposes and not interpreted
  as filenames, programs using them are portable and reliable.</p>
  <h3 id="_program_command_lines">Program command lines</h3>
  <p>The <strong>command-line</strong> procedure specified in
  R<sup>6</sup>RS and R<sup>7</sup>RS returns a list of one or more
  strings. As with OS command lines, the first string is by
  convention the command name. However, <code>(command-line)</code>
  is generally not the same as the OS command line.</p>
  <p>When an implementation is started for the purpose of running a
  Scheme program as a batch job, <code>(command-line)</code> is
  most often a tail of the OS command line such that <code>(car
  (command-line))</code> is the name of the Scheme program and
  <code>(cdr (command-line))</code> are the arguments given to that
  program.</p>
  <p>For example, if the OS command line is:</p>
  <p><code>fantastic-scheme --script program.scm foo bar
  baz</code></p>
  <p>the value of <code>(command-line)</code> generally is:</p>
  <p><code>("program.scm" "foo" "bar" "baz")</code></p>
  <p>Gambit Scheme supports running more than one program in the
  same batch job, with the ability to insert a <em>read-eval-print
  loop</em> in between any pair of programs. In that case the
  command line is given to the last program in the batch (if
  any).</p>
  <p>When a Scheme program is turned into a standalone executable,
  <code>(command-line)</code> and the OS command line are generally
  equivalent. However, the Scheme implementation’s runtime system
  may omit command line options that belong to it. For example,
  Gambit omits the <code>-:</code> option.</p>
  <p>In a read-eval-print loop the value of
  <code>(command-line)</code> is not well specified. A reasonable
  convention from Chez Scheme is to use a zero-length string as the
  command name in this case, with no command line arguments after
  the name.</p>
  <p>Another ambiguous situation arises when using
  <strong>load</strong> or <strong>import</strong> to load some
  code into an implementation. When the implementation loads or
  imports a Scheme library or module to use as a main program, it
  should perhaps set the command name to the name of the module and
  give it any remaining command line arguments. If a library or
  module is loaded or imported to help with another program, and
  not as a main program in its own right, the command line should
  be <code>'("")</code> as in the REPL.</p>
  <h3 id="_taming_the_complexity">Taming the complexity</h3>
  <p>The interface defined by this SRFI is divided into two
  layers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The command layer (<strong>command-line</strong>,
      <strong>command-name</strong>,
      <strong>command-args</strong>)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The script layer (<strong>script-file</strong>,
      <strong>script-directory</strong>)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The command layer applies whenever we are running a Scheme
  program that is given its own command line (in the sense that the
  R<sup>n</sup>RS <strong>command-line</strong> procedure would
  return a useful command line concerning that program
  specifically). Such a command line is normally a tail of the OS
  command line, but may come from other places as well. Kawa offers
  a particularly large number of alternative ways to set it.</p>
  <p>The script layer applies whenever we are running a Scheme
  program from a source file. It does not apply to standalone,
  pre-compiled programs or libraries. The idea is that when running
  simple Scheme scripts, it is often convenient to have them read
  and write data files kept in the same directory as the script
  itself.</p>
  <p>A third layer to access the unabridged command line of the OS
  process is omitted. The process command line can be difficult to
  access from hosted environments such as the Java Virtual Machine,
  which would make this SRFI more difficult to adopt.</p>
  <h2 id="_specification">Specification</h2>
  <h3 id="_terminology">Terminology</h3>
  <h4 id="_top_level_programs">Top-level programs</h4>
  <p>For the purposes of this SRFI, the following
  <strong>are</strong> considered <em>top-level programs</em>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A Scheme program turned into a standalone executable.</li>
    <li>A program whose filename is given on the Scheme
    implementation’s command line for the implementation to execute
    (with or without a command line option such as <code>-s</code>,
    <code>-script</code>, <code>--script</code>, or
    <code>--program</code>).</li>
    <li>A file loaded via <strong>load</strong> or equivalent from
    the REPL.</li>
    <li>A file loaded indirectly via a command line
    evaluate-expression flag (commonly <code>-e</code>).</li>
    <li>A library or module imported via a command line flag
    (commonly <code>-m</code>) for the purpose of running that
    module as a main program.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following <strong>are not</strong> considered top-level
  programs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>A file loaded recursively via <strong>load</strong> from
      another file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A file loaded via <strong>import</strong> (except for a
      <code>-m</code> flag as above).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Code evaluated in a REPL.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A Scheme source file being <em>compiled</em> for use at a
      later time.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, implementation-defined global options or optional
  arguments are permitted that control whether or not
  <strong>load</strong> treats files as top-level programs.</p>
  <h4 id="_commands_and_scripts">Commands and scripts</h4>
  <p>For the purposes of this SRFI, we classify a running Scheme
  program as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>A top-level program given a command line is a
      <em>command</em>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A top-level program run from a source file whose filename
      is known to the implementation is a <em>script</em>. Note
      that a file being compiled and stored away for later
      execution is not a script; only a file loaded to be evaluated
      once immediately is a script. The file may actually be loaded
      from a compiled cache, as long as the source filename is used
      to identify it.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>A running program can be either a command, a script, both at
  once, or neither.</p>
  <h3 id="_command_procedures">Command procedures</h3>
  <p>(<strong>command-line</strong>) ⇒ <em>string-list</em></p>
  <p>This procedure is equivalent to the R<sup>6</sup>RS and
  R<sup>7</sup>RS <strong>command-line</strong> procedure, but
  specified in more detail.</p>
  <p><strong>R<sup>6</sup>RS definition:</strong> "Returns a
  nonempty list of strings. The first element is an
  implementation-specific name for the running top-level program.
  The remaining elements are command-line arguments according to
  the operating system’s conventions."</p>
  <p><strong>R<sup>7</sup>RS definition:</strong> "Returns the
  command line passed to the process as a list of strings. The
  first string corresponds to the command name, and is
  implementation-dependent. It is an error to mutate any of these
  strings."</p>
  <p><strong>Additional stipulations by this SRFI:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>If the calling program is <strong>not</strong> a
      <em>command</em> in this SRFI’s terminology, a list equal to
      <code>("")</code> is returned.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If the calling program is a standalone executable, the
      command line is equal to <code>(os-command-line)</code> with
      any arguments belonging to the Scheme runtime system
      omitted.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If the calling program is a <em>script</em> as well as a
      <em>command</em>, the command name is equal to the filename
      given to <strong>load</strong>, on the command line, in an
      environment variable, etc. The command args are the args (if
      any) that belong to the script.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Otherwise, if the command name comes from a filename, the
      filename is preserved as given to the implementation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>It is an error to mutate a <code>(command-line)</code>
      list returned by the implementation, or any of the strings in
      it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>It is permissible to implement
      <strong>command-line</strong> as a parameter object. In that
      case, the implementation binds the value of the parameter as
      above for the duration of the command. The program may freely
      rebind <strong>command-line</strong> to any other string list
      containing at least one element, either temporarily with
      <strong>parameterize</strong> or permanently.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If a program rebinds the <strong>command-line</strong>
      parameter, the new binding may share structure with the old
      binding.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>(<strong>command-name</strong>) ⇒ <em>string?</em></p>
  <p>Returns a friendly version of <code>(car
  (command-line))</code> evaluated in the current lexical
  environment.</p>
  <p>If <code>(car (command-line))</code> is a zero-length string,
  <code>#f</code> is returned to indicate "not a command".</p>
  <p>Otherwise a friendly command name is typically derived from a
  filename as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The directory part (if any) is removed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Filename extensions known to belong to executable files or
      Scheme scripts on the underlying operating system are removed
      at the discretion of the implementation. For example,
      <code>.exe</code> or <code>.scm</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Other changes may also be made according to local
      conventions.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>For example, on Windows
  <code>C:\fantastic-scheme-1.0.EXE</code> would typically be
  shortened to <code>fantastic-scheme-1.0</code>.</p>
  <p>(<strong>command-args</strong>) ⇒ <em>string-list</em></p>
  <p>Returns <code>(cdr (command-line))</code> evaluated in the
  current lexical environment.</p>
  <h3 id="_script_procedures">Script procedures</h3>
  <p>(<strong>script-file</strong>) ⇒ <em>string?</em></p>
  <p>Returns an absolute pathname pointing to the calling script.
  Symbolic links are not resolved.</p>
  <p>(The script may or may not be a command; use
  <strong>command-name</strong> to find out.)</p>
  <p>If the calling program is not a script, <code>#f</code> is
  returned.</p>
  <p>Implementations must resolve the absolute pathname of a script
  before running that script. The script may change the working
  directory, thereby changing the interpretation of relative
  pathnames.</p>
  <p>(<strong>script-directory</strong>) ⇒ <em>string?</em></p>
  <p>Returns only the directory part of
  <strong>script-file</strong> as a string. As with
  <strong>script-file</strong>, this is an absolute pathname.</p>
  <p>Where possible, the string ends with a pathname component
  separator so that <strong>string-append</strong> can be easily
  used to build pathnames based on it.</p>
  <p>If the calling program is not a script, <code>#f</code> is
  returned.</p>
  <h2 id="_implementation">Implementation</h2>
  <p>Implementations are in progress for Gauche and
  Chibi-Scheme.</p>
  <p>It is not possible to implement this SRFI based on the
  R<sup>n</sup>RS <strong>command-line</strong> procedure. However,
  the <strong>command-line</strong> from this SRFI can serve as a
  conforming implementation of R<sup>n</sup>RS
  <strong>command-line</strong>.</p>
  <h2 id="_acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
  <p>Thanks to Shiro Kawai for the initial implementation in
  Gauche, for patiently reviewing iterations of the design and for
  valuable feedback that solved key problems in it. The interplay
  of <strong>command-line</strong>, <strong>command-name</strong>
  and <strong>command-args</strong> was especially tricky to figure
  out and I had all but given up hope of a satisfying solution.
  With Shiro’s insight a simple and natural approach was finally
  found.</p>
  <p>Eryk Sun and Daniel Colascione helped me understand how
  command lines actually work on Windows in theory and practice - a
  surprisingly complicated topic carrying much historical baggage.
  With their help, we are able to select the right API functions to
  retrieve the OS command line on that platform.</p>

  instructive collection of OS-specific solutions to the executable
  filename problem. Many people also left useful clues in various
  Stack Overflow questions.</p>
