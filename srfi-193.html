  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>R<sup>6</sup>RS and R<sup>7</sup>RS define a
  <strong>command-line</strong> procedure. While a useful baseline,
  the specification is not detailed enough to cover all practical
  situations. This SRFI clarifies the definition of
  <strong>command-line</strong> and adds a few related procedures.
  Precise semantics for Unix and Windows are given. Scheme scripts,
  standalone executables, compilation and REPL use are accounted
  for. Option parsing is out of scope.</p>

  <h2>Rationale</h2>
  <h3>OS executables</h3>
  <p>When a Scheme implementation is run on a conventional
  operating system, the OS runs an <em>executable</em>. An
  executable is a file that contains a program in a format suitable
  for the OS. In the case of Scheme, the executable can
  represent:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>A standalone Scheme program.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A Scheme implementation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A virtual machine (such as the Java Virtual Machine or the
      .NET Common Language Runtime) hosting the Scheme
      implementation, which in turn hosts the Scheme program.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>OS command lines</h3>
  <p>The OS gives the executable a <em>command line</em>. The
  command line is a vector of strings. There is a ubiquitous
  convention that the first string represents the <em>command
  name</em>. Any remaining strings are <em>command arguments</em>
  interpreted differently by each program.</p>
  <h3>Command names are portable but not reliable</h3>
  <p>By convention, the command name is derived from the executable
  filename in one of the following formats:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>An absolute pathname (<code>/usr/bin/emacs</code>)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A relative pathname (<code>../bin/emacs</code>)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A basename only with no directory part
      (<code>emacs</code>)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, it is important to note that the command name is
  <em>an arbitrary string</em> that is stored <em>wholly
  separate</em> from the executable filename. A change in one does
  not necessarily affect the other. Popular operating systems like
  Unix and Windows let programs easily start other programs with an
  arbitrary command name. The name is not validated in any way by
  the OS. That’s why it is not a reliable hint for determining the
  executable filename.</p>
  <p>The upside of command lines, and hence command names, is that
  they are extremely portable. Practically all general-purpose
  operating systems provide them. As long as command names are used
  for display purposes and not interpreted as filenames, programs
  using them are portable and reliable.</p>
  <h3>Executable filenames are reliable but not portable</h3>
  <p>It is equally important to keep in mind that the executable
  filename is <em>not</em> arbitrary like the command name is. When
  the OS process is launched, the executable filename has to be
  valid. (Any one executable generally has many valid filenames
  since we can use relative filenames, make hard links and symbolic
  links in the file system, etc.) Unix-like operating systems
  generally allow the executable file to be moved, renamed or
  deleted after the executable has been loaded into memory. While
  the executable filename was guaranteed to be valid at the time of
  process creation, it does not necessarily remain valid throughout
  the lifetime of the process. However, it is generally both more
  reliable and more specific than the command name.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, system calls that retrieve the executable
  filename are extremely non-portable and not at all standardized.
  Portable programs can make use of the executable filename where
  it is available, but must be prepared to handle the case where it
  is not.</p>
  <h3>Program command lines</h3>
  <p>The <strong>command-line</strong> procedure specified in
  R<sup>6</sup>RS and R<sup>7</sup>RS returns a list of one or more
  strings. As with OS command lines, the first string is by
  convention the command name. However, <code>(command-line)</code>
  is generally not the same as the OS command line.</p>
  <p>When an implementation is started for the purpose of running a
  Scheme program as a batch job, <code>(command-line)</code> is
  most often a tail of the OS command line such that <code>(car
  (command-line))</code> is the name of the Scheme program and
  <code>(cdr (command-line))</code> are the arguments given to that
  program.</p>
  <p>For example, if the OS command line is:</p>
  <p><code>fantastic-scheme --script program.scm foo bar
  baz</code></p>
  <p>the value of <code>(command-line)</code> generally is:</p>
  <p><code>("program.scm" "foo" "bar" "baz")</code></p>
  <p>Some Schemes support running more than one program in the same
  batch job, with the ability to insert a <em>read-eval-print
  loop</em> in between any pair of scripts. In that case the
  command line is given to the last program in the batch (if
  any).</p>
  <p>When a Scheme program is turned into a standalone executable,
  <code>(command-line)</code> and the OS command line are generally
  equivalent. However, the Scheme implementation’s runtime system
  may omit command line options that belong to it. For example,
  Gambit omits the <code>-:</code> option.</p>
  <p>In a read-eval-print loop the value of
  <code>(command-line)</code> is not well specified. A reasonable
  convention from Chez Scheme is to use a zero-length string as the
  command name in this case.</p>
  <p>Another ambiguous situation arises when using
  <strong>load</strong> or <strong>import</strong> to load some
  code into an implementation.</p>
  <h3>Taming the complexity</h3>
  <p>The interface defined by this SRFI is divided into three
  layers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>OS layer (<strong>os-executable-file</strong>,
      <strong>os-command-line</strong>)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Command layer (<strong>command-line</strong>,
      <strong>command-name</strong>,
      <strong>command-args</strong>)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Script layer (<strong>script-file</strong>,
      <strong>script-directory</strong>)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The OS layer always concerns the operating system’s idea of
  the executable.</p>
  <p>The command layer applies whenever we are running a Scheme
  program that is given its own command line (in the sense that the
  R<sup>n</sup>RS <strong>command-line</strong> procedure would
  return a useful command line concerning that program
  specifically). Such a command line is normally a tail of the OS
  command line, but may come from other places as well. Kawa offers
  a particularly large number of alternative ways to set it.</p>
  <p>The script layer applies whenever we are running a Scheme
  program from a source file. It does not apply to standalone,
  pre-compiled programs or libraries. The idea is that when running
  simple Scheme scripts, it is often convenient to have them read
  and write data files kept in the same directory as the script
  itself.</p>
  <h2>Specification</h2>
  <h3>Terminology</h3>
  <h4>Top-level programs</h4>
  <p>For the purposes of this SRFI, the following
  <strong>are</strong> considered <em>top-level programs</em>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>A Scheme program turned into a standalone executable.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A program whose filename is given on the Scheme
      implementation’s command line for the implementation to
      execute (with or without a command line option such as
      <code>-s</code>, <code>-script</code>, <code>--script</code>,
      or <code>--program</code>).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A file loaded via <strong>load</strong> from the REPL, or
      from a command line <code>-e</code> (evaluate expresssion)
      flag.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following <strong>are not</strong> considered top-level
  programs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>A file loaded via <strong>load</strong> from another
      file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A file loaded implicitly via <strong>import</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Code evaluated in a REPL.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A Scheme source file being <em>compiled</em>.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, implementation-defined global options or optional
  arguments are permitted that control whether or not
  <strong>load</strong> treats files as top-level programs.</p>
  <h4>Commands and scripts</h4>
  <p>For the purposes of this SRFI, we classify a running Scheme
  program as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>A top-level program given a command line is a
      <em>command</em>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A top-level program run from a source file whose filename
      is known to the implementation is a <em>script</em>. Note
      that a file being compiled and stored away for later
      execution is not a script; only a file loaded to be evaluated
      once immediately is a script. The file may actually be loaded
      from a compiled cache, as long as the source filename is used
      to identify it.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>A running program can be either a command, a script, both at
  once, or neither.</p>
  <h3>OS procedures</h3>
  <p>(<strong>os-executable-file</strong>) ⇒ <em>string?</em></p>
  <p>Returns an absolute pathname pointing to the executable file
  running the Scheme program. If the Scheme program is running as a
  standalone executable, this returns the filename of that
  executable. Otherwise this returns the filename of the executable
  housing the Scheme implementation. If the Scheme implementation
  is hosted on top of a virtual machine such as the JVM or the CLR,
  the executable filename will probably point to that virtual
  machine.</p>
  <p><code>#f</code> is returned if no pathname can be retrieved.
  Some operating systems do not give the information at all. Some
  give it in an unreliable manner which this procedure cannot use.
  Hence a <code>#f</code> return value is not extraordinary, and
  portable Scheme code calling this procedure should be prepared to
  handle it.</p>
  <p>If there is more than one pathname pointing to the executable
  (e.g. via symbolic links or hard links), it is undefined which
  one of them is returned. The pathname is also not guaranteed to
  be in a normal form. Many operating systems have a "realpath"
  system call to simplify any given pathname into its most
  canonical form. Implementations may or may not use such a
  procedure to normalize the filename. The only guarantee from this
  SRFI is that an absolute instead of relative filename is
  returned. An absolute filename is important in case the program
  changes its working directory later.</p>
  <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> This problem presents a
  particularly compelling set of almost-working solutions to lure
  implementors onto the rocks. At the time of writing there is no
  correct approach that is even moderately portable. Please be
  skeptical of any claim that a portable and correct approach
  exists.</p>
  <p>In particular, all of the following approaches are
  incorrect.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Using the current directory (AKA the working directory) is
      liable to break all the time. Programs other than simple
      scripts for personal use are rarely started from the
      directory in which they live; starting programs from
      arbitrary directories using either <code>PATH</code> lookup
      or an absolute or relative pathname is common.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>No <code>argv[0]</code> based approach works properly.
      <code>argv[0]</code> is simply an arbitrary string passed to
      <code>execve()</code> in its <em>argv</em> argument. By
      convention it is the program name. But contrary to popular
      belief there is no mechanism enforcing that convention.
      Multi-call binaries such as <code>busybox</code> deliberately
      take advantage of this lack of enforcement - the same
      executable can be started with any number of different
      names.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Note that <code>execve()</code> takes separate
      <em>path</em> and <em>argv</em> arguments. Only <em>path</em>
      is checked to see that it points to a real file. Lamentably,
      there is no portable API to retrieve <em>path</em> from
      within the child process. Only <em>argv</em> retrieval is
      portable.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>When a process is started using its command name, with no
      directory part, directories in <code>PATH</code> are
      traversed to find a matching executable. Some programs try to
      find their own executable by replicating a <code>PATH</code>
      search for <code>argv[0]</code> when <code>argv[0]</code>
      does not contain a directory part. This does not work for two
      reasons: it’s trivial to pass a fake <code>argv[0]</code>,
      and even with a truthful <code>argv[0]</code> the parent
      process may not have used the same search path that it gave
      to the child process.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Opening a candidate executable to compute a checksum of
      its bytes and find out whether it is the same as the current
      executable, presents a chicken-and-egg problem: where do you
      get the checksum for the current executable to verify
      against? It is also possible to install multiple copies of
      the same executable at different locations, in which case
      their checksums would match but not their filenames.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following is a partial list of correct approaches at the
  time of writing.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Darwin (macOS, iOS):
      <code>_NSGetExecutablePath()</code></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD: <code>sysctl({ CTL_KERN,
      KERN_PROC, KERN_PROC_PATHNAME, -1 })</code></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Linux: <code>readlink("/proc/self/exe")</code></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>NetBSD: <code>sysctl({ CTL_KERN, KERN_PROC_ARGS, -1,
      KERN_PROC_PATHNAME })</code></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>OpenBSD: pathname intentionally unavailable</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>QNX: read (not readlink)
      <code>/proc/self/exefile</code></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Solaris: <code>getexecname()</code> or
      <code>readlink("/proc/self/path/a.out")</code></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Windows NT: <code>GetModuleFileNameW(NULL)</code></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Most of these procedures take a pre-allocated string buffer
  and copy the filename into it. An effective tactic is to call the
  procedure in a loop, doubling the size of the buffer at each
  iteration until the filename fits or an upper limit is
  reached.</p>
  <p>(<strong>os-command-line</strong>) ⇒ <em>string-list</em></p>
  <p>Returns the command line of the executable running the Scheme
  program. The command line from the operating system is converted
  to a list of Scheme strings. No other preprocessing (flag
  parsing, separating runtime and script arguments, case
  conversion, etc.) is performed.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>On Unix, returns a list equivalent to the <em>argv</em>
      array. Each bytevector in <em>argv</em> is converted to a
      Scheme string based on the character encoding prescribed by
      the current locale. In case the locale encoding is unknown or
      unsupported, <strong>utf8-&gt;string</strong> is an
      acceptable fallback. The implementation should document which
      encodings it supports.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>On Windows NT, returns a list equivalent to passing the
      string from <code>GetCommandLineW()</code> to the splitting
      function <code>CommandLineToArgvW()</code> and converting the
      resulting vector of UTF-16-LE encoded argument strings to
      Scheme strings. In principle, it is possible to re-implement
      <code>CommandLineToArgvW()</code> entirely in Scheme using
      Scheme strings.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>On Windows NT using the UTF-8 codepage,
      <code>GetCommandLineA()</code> may be used to obtain
      equivalent results. As of this writing there is no
      <code>CommandLineToArgvA()</code> in the Windows API; a
      Scheme equivalent could be written.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please note that <code>(car (os-command-line))</code> and
  <code>(os-executable-file)</code> are two completely different
  things. The two strings can be equal if you get lucky, but are
  not at all interchangeable in principle, and often not in
  practice either.</p>
  <h3>Command procedures</h3>
  <p>(<strong>command-line</strong>) ⇒ <em>string-list</em></p>
  <p>This procedure is equivalent to the R<sup>6</sup>RS and
  R<sup>7</sup>RS <strong>command-line</strong> procedure, but
  specified in more detail.</p>
  <p><strong>R<sup>6</sup>RS definition:</strong> "Returns a
  nonempty list of strings. The first element is an
  implementation-specific name for the running top-level program.
  The remaining elements are command-line arguments according to
  the operating system’s conventions."</p>
  <p><strong>R<sup>7</sup>RS definition:</strong> "Returns the
  command line passed to the process as a list of strings. The
  first string corresponds to the command name, and is
  implementation-dependent. It is an error to mutate any of these
  strings."</p>
  <p><strong>Additional stipulations by this SRFI:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>If the calling program is <strong>not</strong> a
      <em>command</em> in this SRFI’s terminology, a list equal to
      <code>("")</code> is returned.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If the calling program is a standalone executable, the
      command line is equal to <code>(os-command-line)</code> with
      any arguments belonging to the Scheme runtime system
      omitted.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If the calling program is a <em>script</em> as well as a
      <em>command</em>, the command name is equal to the filename
      given to <strong>load</strong>, on the command line, in an
      environment variable, etc. The command args are the args (if
      any) that belong to the script.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Otherwise, if the command name comes from a filename, the
      filename is preserved as given to the implementation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>It is an error to mutate a <code>(command-line)</code>
      list returned by the implementation, or any of the strings in
      it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>It is permissible to implement
      <strong>command-line</strong> as a parameter object. In that
      case, the implementation binds the value of the parameter as
      above for the duration of the command. The program may freely
      rebind <strong>command-line</strong> to any other string list
      containing at least one element, either temporarily with
      <strong>parameterize</strong> or permanently.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If a program rebinds the <strong>command-line</strong>
      parameter, the new binding may share structure with the old
      binding.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>(<strong>command-name</strong>) ⇒ <em>string?</em></p>
  <p>Returns a friendly version of <code>(car
  (command-line))</code> evaluated in the current lexical
  environment.</p>
  <p>If <code>(car (command-line))</code> is a zero-length string,
  <code>#f</code> is returned to indicate "not a command".</p>
  <p>Otherwise a friendly command name is typically derived from a
  filename as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The directory part (if any) is removed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Filename extensions known to belong to executable files or
      Scheme scripts on the underlying operating system are removed
      at the discretion of the implementation. For example,
      <code>.exe</code> or <code>.scm</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Other changes may also be made according to local
      conventions.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>For example, on Windows
  <code>C:\fantastic-scheme-1.0.EXE</code> would typically be
  shortened to <code>fantastic-scheme-1.0</code>.</p>
  <p>(<strong>command-args</strong>) ⇒ <em>string-list</em></p>
  <p>Returns <code>(cdr (command-line))</code> evaluated in the
  current lexical environment.</p>
  <h3>Script procedures</h3>
  <p>(<strong>script-file</strong>) ⇒ <em>string?</em></p>
  <p>Returns an absolute pathname pointing to the calling script.
  Symbolic links are not resolved.</p>
  <p>(The script may or may not be a command; use
  <strong>command-name</strong> to find out.)</p>
  <p>If the calling program is not a script, <code>#f</code> is
  returned.</p>
  <p>Implementations must resolve the absolute pathname of a script
  before running that script. The script may change the working
  directory, thereby changing the interpretation of relative
  pathnames.</p>
  <p>(<strong>script-directory</strong>) ⇒ <em>string?</em></p>
  <p>Returns only the directory part of
  <strong>script-file</strong> as a string. As with
  <strong>script-file</strong>, this is an absolute pathname.</p>
  <p>Where possible, the string ends with a pathname component
  separator so that <strong>string-append</strong> can be easily
  used to build pathnames based on it.</p>
  <p>If the calling program is not a script, <code>#f</code> is

  <p>Implementations are in progress for Gauche and
  Chibi-Scheme.</p>
  <p>It is not possible to implement this SRFI based on the
  R<sup>n</sup>RS <strong>command-line</strong> procedure. However,
  the <strong>command-line</strong> from this SRFI can serve as a
  conforming implementation of R<sup>n</sup>RS
  <strong>command-line</strong>.</p>
  <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
  <p>Thanks to Shiro Kawai for the initial implementation in
  Gauche, for patiently reviewing iterations of the design and for
  valuable feedback that solved key problems in it. The interplay
  of <strong>command-line</strong>, <strong>command-name</strong>
  and <strong>command-args</strong> was especially tricky to figure
  out and I had all but given up hope of a satisfying solution.
  With Shiro’s insight a simple and natural approach was finally
  found.</p>
  <p>Eryk Sun and Daniel Colascione helped me understand how
  command lines actually work on Windows in theory and practice - a
  surprisingly complicated topic carrying much historical baggage.
  With their help, we are able to select the right API functions to
  retrieve the OS command line on that platform.</p>
  <p>Gregory Pakosz wrote the <em>whereami</em> library, an
  instructive collection of OS-specific solutions to the executable
  filename problem. Many people also left useful clues in various
  Stack Overflow questions.</p>
